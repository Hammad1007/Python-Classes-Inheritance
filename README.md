# Python-Classes-Inheritance

Create a class for rectangle shape that calculates its area based upon the
length and width. Make a sub class of triangle called Trapezium, such
that it inherits the functionality of rectangle class and implements area method of its
own. Length and width should be defined in the constructor of rectangle class.

Area of Rectangle = Length * Width

Area of Trapezium = Â½ * (l + w) * h

After creation of the class, define the relevant attributes. Define a function for area computation
and then a function for displaying area. Incorporate your knowledge of class and objects here.
